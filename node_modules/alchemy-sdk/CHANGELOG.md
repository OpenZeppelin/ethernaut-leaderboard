# Changelog for Alchemy SDK for JavaScript

## Unreleased

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

## 2.4.1

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes
- Added the `NftNamespace.getTransfersForOwner()` method to get all NFT transfers to or from a provided owner address.
- Added the `NftNamespace.getTransfersForContract()` method to all the NFT transfers for a provided NFT contract address.
- Deprecated the `GetMintedNftsResponse` interface in favor of the `TransfersNftResponse`. The `TransfersNftResponse` contains the same properties as the `GetMintedNftsResponse` and includes additional fields about the transfer.

## 2.4.0

### Major Changes

- Added `TransactNamespace.simulateAssetChanges()` to simulate a transaction and return a list of asset changes.
- Added `TransactNamespace.simulateExecution()` to simulate a transaction and return a list of decoded logs and traces.

### Minor Changes

## 2.3.1

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- Added support for passing in a `null` `tokenId` when using NFT Webhook Filters, which allows you to listen to all token ids in a collection.
- Added `NftNamespace.getMintedNfts()` to fetch all the NFTs an owner address minted, optionally filtered by a set of specific NFT contracts.
- Added the option to pass in an `EventFilter` with multiple addresses to the `CoreNamespace.getLogs()` method.
- Fixed a bug where the `protocolFee` was not included in the response for `NftNamespace.getNftSales()`. Deprecated the existing `marketplaceFee` property in favor of the new `protocolFee` property.

## 2.3.0

### Major Changes

- Added the `DebugNamespace` to the top-level `Alchemy` object. The `DebugNamespace` is used to replay and inspect transactions and mined blocks in greater detail.

### Minor Changes

- Added the `tokenUriTimeoutInMs` option to `NftNamespace.getNftsForContract()` to specify the timeout duration for fetching an NFT's underlying metadata.
- Fixed a bug where using `AlchemySubscriptions.PENDING_TRANSACTIONS` with a string array input would throw an error (#222).
- Added support for the `refreshCache` option in `NftNamespace.getNftMetadata()`. This option is now available when using the `options` overload. The original method without the `options` overload is now deprecated.
- Added support for the `requestTimeout` option in the `AlchemySettings` object to configure a timeout for `NftNamespace` and `NotifyNamespace` methods. Thanks @Abbaskt!
- Added the `contractDeployer` and `deployedBlockNumber` into the `NftContract` object. Methods that return NFTs such as `NftNamespace.getNftsForOwner()` and `NftNamespace.getContractsForOwner()` now include this information under the `contract` field.

## 2.2.5

### Major Changes

- Added `NftNamespace.getContractsForOwner()` to fetch all NFT contracts for a specified owner address.

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug in `NftNamespace.getNftsForOwner()` where the `openSea` metadata was not included in the returned NFT.
- Marked the `NftExcludeFilters` type as deprecated. Please use `NftFilters` instead.
- Added support for the `orderBy` param to `NftNamespace.getNftsForOwner()` and `NftNamespace.getContractsForOwner()`.

## 2.2.4

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug where `newHeads` subscriptions would error and crash when reconnecting to the websocket.

## 2.2.2 (DEPRECATED)

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- Added support for ENS resolution to the `NotifyNamespace` and `WebsocketNamespace` methods.
- Added the `batchRequests` setting in `AlchemySettings`. Enabling this setting will automatically batch and send json-rpc requests to reduce network overhead.
- Included new export for the `Interface` class from ethers to simplify encoding ABI when using `eth_call`.
- Added support for the `NftNamespace.getNftMetadataBatch()` method to fetch metadata for multiple NFTs in a single call.
- Added support for the `NftNamespace.getNftSales()` method to fetch NFT sales across different marketplaces. Thanks @xeno097!

## 2.2.1

### Major Changes

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug where `AlchemyConfig.getWebsocketProvider()` was not exported as a public method. This method allows you get the underlying `WebsocketProvider` that is implemented by ethers.
- Added the `NftNamespace.summarizeNftAttributes()` method to get the summary of attribute prevalence for all NFTs in a contract.
- Added the `NftNamespace.searchContractMetadata()` method to search for a keyword across ERC721 and ERC1155 contract metadata.
- Added support for ENS resolution on several `CoreNamespace` methods. You should now be able to pass in an ENS domain into any param that requires an owner address.
- Added the `CoreNamespace.resolveName()` and `CoreNamespace.lookupAddress()` methods to resolve and lookup ENS domains and their owner addresses.
- Fixed a bug where the `Accept-Encoding` header was incorrectly included in requests that originated from the browser (#174).
- Added the `openSea` response to `NftNamespace.getContractMetadata()`to match the REST endpoint (#162).

## 2.2.0

### Major Changes

- Added the `NotifyNamespace` to the top-level `Alchemy` object. The `NotifyNamespace` is used to perform CRUD operations on webhooks in the Notify API.
- Added the `alchemy_minedTransactions` subscription event to the `WebsocketNamespace`. This subscription emits full transaction objects or hashes that are mined on the network based on provided filters.
- Added the `NftNamespace.computeRarity()` method to get the rarity attributes of the provided NFT. Thanks @xeno097!

### Minor Changes

## 2.1.1

### Minor Changes

- Added the `AIDROPS` enum to `NftNamespace.getNftsForOwner()`.
- Added the `spamInfo` field to the response for `getNftsForOwner()` and `getNftsForContract()`.
- Fixed a bug where type declarations were not available when using `NodeNext` module resolution. Thanks @quentinverlhac!
- Marked Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Kovan `Network` enums as deprecated. Please switch over to Goerli.

## 2.1.0

### Major Changes

- POTENTIALLY BREAKING: Fixed a typing bug where the `totalSupply` field in an `NftContract` should have type `string` instead of `number`.
- Updated the `Nft` class to include the contract metadata in the `Nft.contract` field.
- Added commonly used utility methods from ethers.js into a top-level `Utils` export.
- Added the `NftNamespace.verifyNftOwnership()` method to replace the deprecated `checkNftOwnership()` method.
- Added `Contract` and `ContractFactory` exports from ethers into the top-level exports.

### Minor Changes

- Added support for the `erc20` token type and pagination for `CoreNamespace.getTokenBalances()`.
- Added `bytes` field to the `Media` object in the NFT metadata responses to indicate the size of the media in bytes. Note that the `size` field is not supported by the backend and will be removed in the next version.

## 2.0.4

### Minor Changes

- Added a `size` field to the `Media` object in the NFT metadata responses to indicate the size of the media in bytes.
- Bumped `@ethersproject` dependencies to `v5.7.0` to support `safe` and `finalized` blocks.

## 2.0.3

### Minor Changes

- Added support for the `pageSize` parameter in `GetNftsForOwnerOptions` to specify the number of NFTs fetched when using `alchemy.nft.getNftsForOwner()`.
- Added support for a Wallet object. This object is identical to the Ethers `Wallet` class.
- Added support for Arbitrum Goerli network via the `Network.ARB_GOERLI` enum.
- Added support for the AStar Mainnet network via the `Network.ASTAR_MAINNET` enum.
- Added typed request/response overloads for `CoreNamespace.getAssetTransfers()` for when the `withMetadata` param is true.
- Added support the `tokenUriTimeoutInMs` parameter on `getNftsForOwner()`, `getNftMetadata()`, and `getNftsForContract()`.

## 2.0.2

- Added the `pageSize` parameter in `GetNftsForContractOptions` to specify the number of NFTs fetched when using `alchemy.nft.getNftsForContract`.
- Added correct `withMetadata` typing to `AssetTransfersResponse`.

## 2.0.1

### Minor Changes

- Added an optional `url` setting to `AlchemySettings` to allow specifying a custom hardcoded URL to send all requests to.
- Fixed a bug where the SDK would incorrectly include a gzip header in browser environments

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- Top level package has moved from `@alch/alchemy-sdk` to `alchemy-sdk` for convenience. New command to install is `npm install alchemy-sdk`
- Updated instantiation syntax: `initializeAlchemy(settings)` is now `new Alchemy(settings)`
- Added three namespaces under the Alchemy object: `core`, `nft`, and `ws`. All Ethers.js provider methods and Alchemy Enhanced APIs (other than NFT) are under `core`.
- Moved top-level methods under the Alchemy object. Instead of `getNftsByOwner(alchemy, 'vitalik.eth')`, now methods are called using `alchemy.nft.getNftsByOwner('vitalik.eth')`
- Ethers.js Alchemy Provider methods are now directly embedded under `alchemy.core`
- Ethers.js WebSocket Provider methods are now directly embedded under `alchemy.ws`
- The settings object is now a config module under `alchemy.config`.
- If necessary, the full Ethers.js Provider is now available under `alchemy.config.getProvider()` as a promise to reduce bundle size.
- If necessary, the full WebSocket Provider is now available under `alchemy.config.getWebSocketProvider()` as a promise to reduce bundle size.
- Dynamic imports for large methods (in particular, Ethers.js methods) are now supported. Initial package size for the Alchemy SDK is 20kB, and will only download Ethers.js packages when a relevant method is called.
- Methods including Collection in the NFT package have been renamed to `Contract`: for instance, `getNftsForCollection` is now `getNftsForContract`.
